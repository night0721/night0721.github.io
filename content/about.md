# About this website

This website is written with only HTML, CSS and JS as I want to maximise the performance of the website but without the bloated JavaScript from modern frameworks.  
I wanted to use the website as a special place for my imagination, writing without the restriction from social media. The posts here will be mostly about programming and Linux.  
The creation of the website is highly inspirated by [BugsWriter](https://bugswriter.com/") and [Eric Murphy](https://ericmurphy.xyz/"), all credits go to them.
