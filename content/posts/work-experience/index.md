During my work experience at this summer, working with Devtank Ltd, I have been in touch with low level development. Upon knowing their product (OSM) structure, I learnt about how different repositories are used together for OSM to work, with a web interface connecting to a firmware and using Ansible to setup the virtual machines.

Moreover, I used virtual machiens to perform testing on firmware blobs whilst using QEMU to boot up virtual machines. I also used SSH to remote control multiple computers to run different programs and debug them.

As the company is about open source hardware and software, I also contributed to the documenation by adding missing points to the manuals to make the process of building and contribution easier for the public.

In terms of my personal skills, I was introduced a lot of programming books on the way. Furthermore, learning about git submodules and "static" keyword in C language.
